#This is a simple back and forth game like pokemon Weapon damage is the base amount for the weapon equation that will be used as the goblins weapon as well. defending halfs your damage taken at the next turn and if you are hit during that defence turn by a critical hit you will counter with a 5000 damage attack. This is high skill gameplay for only EPIC gamers like myself, the commands for attacking and defending are just as typed "ATTACK" or "DEFEND"
